Movie Library done in Windows Forms (for C# class)

Purpose: Application that stores movies in a database.  Each movie will have 
a name, description, runtime(length), and a status for whether or not it is owned.

If you choose to build and run the application you may need to deploy the database,
otherwise I put the release folder in the same location as this Readme if that is 
easier.
