Persona Fusion App (Project Prototype for Systems Analysis and Design Class)

This class was mainly about design and project planning, but we also completed
a project of our choice at the end of the semester.

I chose to make a guide for fusing different creatures called personas 
in the game "Persona 5".  You can find the different personas by browsing 
menus or by typing their name in the search bar.  Since we were only required to 
submit a prototype, many of the personas were not implemented.
